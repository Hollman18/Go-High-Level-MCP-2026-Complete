# CLI Commands

Use these commands from the repository root. Keep command behavior MCP-focused: build and run the server, refresh tool coverage, and verify the exported tool surface.

## Server Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Builds the MCP server into `dist/`. |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the TypeScript entry point with `nodemon` for local iteration. |
| `npm run start:stdio` | Starts the stdio MCP server from `dist/server.js`. Use this for most desktop MCP clients. |
| `npm run start:http` | Starts the HTTP server from `dist/main.js`. Use this for HTTP transports and local `/tools` inspection. |
| `npm run start:legacy` | Starts the older HTTP entry point from `dist/http-server.js` when compatibility testing it. |

## Quality Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | Runs the build checker without emitting server output. |
| `npm test` | Runs Jest tests. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Runs Jest with coverage reporting. |
| `npm run validate:api-lock` | Verifies `docs/api-sources.lock.json` matches generated API coverage artifacts. |

## Companion CLI Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run tools:doctor` | Checks Node, build output, local env, and generated API coverage state. |
| `npm run tools:list` | Lists registered MCP tools from the built registry. Supports `--search`, `--category`, and `--stability`. |
| `npm run tools:report` | Writes `docs/API-DASHBOARD.md` and `docs/tool-inventory.json`. |
| `npm run tools:explorer` | Prints the local static explorer path for browsing `docs/tool-inventory.json`. |
| `npm run tools:configure` | Prints a Codex-compatible stdio MCP config snippet. |
| `npm run tools:update-api` | Runs the official API refresh pipeline. |
| `node scripts/ghl-mcp.mjs test-tool <name> '<json>'` | Executes one tool locally. Write/delete tools require `--confirm`. |

The package also exposes `ghl-mcp` as a bin command after install or publish.

## API Coverage Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run scan:ghl-api` | Refreshes the upstream GHL docs checkout, regenerates official spec tools, rescans coverage, validates the source lock, classifies local-only endpoints, and regenerates the dashboard/inventory. |
| `npm run ci:ghl-api-drift` | Runs the scanner and fails if generated coverage, source lock, dashboard, inventory, or generated official tools changed. |
| `node scripts/scan-ghl-api-coverage.mjs --refresh` | Refreshes `tmp/highlevel-api-docs` from `GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs` and writes coverage outputs. |
| `node scripts/generate-official-spec-tools.mjs` | Regenerates official fallback MCP tools from `docs/ghl-api-coverage.json`. |

## Live Smoke Command

`npm run smoke:ghl-live` runs read-only checks against the configured GHL account, including current Email V2 list endpoints. It exits cleanly without credentials, so it can be wired into local preflight without leaking secrets into CI logs.

Required variables:

```sh
GHL_API_KEY=...
GHL_LOCATION_ID=...
```

Optional variables:

```sh
GHL_BASE_URL=https://services.leadconnectorhq.com
GHL_API_VERSION=2023-02-21
GHL_LIVE_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_MS=15000
```

Optional POST-based smoke checks stay disabled unless `GHL_LIVE_WRITE_SMOKE=1` is set. These are limited to non-mutating search-style calls unless a future check explicitly documents a create/delete cleanup pair.
